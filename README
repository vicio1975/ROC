##ROC curve##
This code allows to define the ROC curve.
The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves are used
due to their comprehensive, understandable and visually
attractive way of accuracy assessment. This method is used to validate
a numerical flood risk model. The validation process was implemented
by comparing the existing flood data with the acquired
flood probability map.
